This directory contains [presentational and container components](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0), and also [/ducks folder](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/scaling-your-redux-app-with-ducks-6115955638be/). PascalCase should be used for component file name. 

Test file and Stories file for each component must be located next to the code they are testing / documenting so that relative imports appear shorter. For example, if App.test.js and App.js are in the same folder, the test just needs to import App from './App' instead of a long relative path. **For test file naming convention use  *.spec.tsx***
